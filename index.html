                        <h1>About me</h1>
                        <p>
                            Hi there! My name is Michael Yeaple. I'm a Software Engineer <a href="#stuff-i-do">among many other things</a>. I've loved technology for as long as I can remember. 
                            My aunt Susie told me that when I was just a baby, I would sit on her lap in front of the computer, enthralled by it.
                            I grew up playing a lot of video games and messing with computers. My parents even put some software on the computer to lock down the times of day and length of time I was allowed to be on it for.
                            ...I may or may not have found a way around it in a short period of time. As you can probably guess, it was a no brainer for me to pursue an education and career in Software Engineering.
                            This site is a small glimpse into who I am and what I do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from my love for technology: I'm passionate about learning, being challenged, and helping others. I believe these passions makes me a better Software Engineer because: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Learning is a critical skill in any technology field since the landscape changes so rapidly.</li>
                                <li>Challenges are an everyday occurrence in software. Creativity, problem solving, and keeping a cool head are all important assets in Software Engineering. Embracing challenges is the only way to get better--even if you fail along the way!</li>
                                <li>Mentoring and learning from others helps keep everyone up-to-date, improves morale, and brings teams closer together.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            I've worked on a wide variety of things at Pharos. Some of the highlights include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Helping to improve our Cake build process</li>
                                <li>Redesigning and implementing our authentication and secure print client</li>
                                <li>Improving our Android app for Ricoh iMFPs</li>
                                <li>Building multiple PoCs</li>
                                <li>Microservices!</li>
                            </ul>
                            My team was responsible for the redesign and implementation of our authentication and secure print client. This was a fun and unique challenge
                            because our client is browser-based in an effort to reduce the amount of client-specific logic we would have to write. This limitation in
                            conjunction with the limitations of integrated Multi Functional Printer (iMFP) browsers resulted in us writing our own pure TypeScript web client app.
                            The app has no runtime dependencies other than those required by certain vendors to interact with their iMFPs--which are only delivered to the client in
                            the case that it's running on an iMFP that requires them. The resulting application is a lot more performant than the legacy application
                            and is also a lot more streamlined. I'm very proud of the work my team and I put into this one.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I spent my first year at Wegmans on a Support Development team. I had worked on designing and developing a system to distribute seasonal items.
                            The goal was to reduce the amount of items that would have to be sold on clearance after the season for the item had ended. I worked on productionalizing
                            this application in addition to supporting many other legacy apps, while also developing a few new ones. It was here that I picked up an appreciation for
                            writing stable, maintainable software, since we had an on-call rotation that had a tendency to be pretty rough.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After my first year at Wegmans, I was given an amazing opportunity to join the Enterprise Services (ES) team and was promoted shortly thereafter. 
                            This would prove to be a great learning opportunity for me. As a part of the ES team, I got to design and implement services that much of the
                            internal organization and even some external sources would utilize in their systems. I learned how to write more resilient software, what message queues are
                            and when/how to use them, and I got to be on the forefront of helping to move Wegmans infrastructure into the cloud (Microsoft Azure).

                            The first time around at RDI, I gained a solid understanding of relational databases.
                            Additionally, I spent some time doing IT administration--such as setting up and maintaining servers, networking, and more--which helped round out my skill set a bit more.
                            During my time here on both occasions, I helped to develop in-house software on the FileMaker platform for sales representatives as well as developing websites for customers in PHP on a MAMP stack.

                        <p>
                            CloudCheckr has been one of my favorite experiences to date. There's nothing quite like the start-up vibe when you're surrounded by good people.
                            While I was here, I worked as a full-stack web developer in ASP.NET (C#). I worked with the ever-talented Bob Pease who I learned tons of great things from such as how to properly divide responsibilities into classes.
                            Unfortunately, it was a little too late for the code base since I had already been using dictionaries (A.K.A. hash maps) everywhere instead of semantically meaningful objects...
                            Hindsight is 20-20, right? Some of the things I worked on included:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Automating deployment processes via Powershell</li>
                                <li>Developing many resource utilization and cost reports</li>

                            <p>I've done a little freelance work alongside some personal projects on my own time. 
                                Most of the time, the relevant activites to Software Engineering that I do outside of work are reading up or toying with new technologies to learn them.

                            <h2>Just Write</h2>
                            <p>
                                Just Write was a project that was meant to help encourage my client's writing-based Slack community to write more often.
                                The application was a combination of Slack webhooks alongside a web app. Users could type simple commands in Slack to log the 
                                time the had spent writing, and then they would be provided with links to the web application to see a dashboard with charts, 
                                statistics, and insights about their writing habits.
                                The first iteration and proof-of-concept was written in Ruby on the Ruby on Rails (RoR) framework. The final application was written in .NET Core.
                                I made the decision to switch to .NET Core after the PoC since I'm very familiar with the .NET tech stack. Therefore, I felt more comfortable 
                                supporting and maintaining that than a RoR application.

                            I say "quarter and semester" since we switched from quarters to semesters halfway through my college career!

                            Outside of Software Engineering, my time is filled with many other activities. 
                            I enjoy weightlifting to keep active. I love food and drink. You'll often find me cooking, crafting cocktails,
                            and baking sourdough bread. I also play guitar and sing. I enjoy hiking, but I like to be challenged when I go
                            hiking--which typically means climbing mountains. Lastly, I love spending time hanging out with my amazing friends and family.
